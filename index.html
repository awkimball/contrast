    <h2>About me - under construction</h2>
    <img src="assets/img/me.png" alt="Me and my parents" style="width: 20vw; float: right; margin: 1rem 2rem">
    <p>Welcome, my name is Addison Kimball and I'm a 3<sup>rd</sup> year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at Southern Methodist University. 
        Originally from Woodstock, Illinois, I attended <a href="https://www.sps.edu">St. Paul's School</a> in Concord, New Hampshire.
        I am an only child, and I spend the Summer with my parents Beau (Addison Sr.) and Nancy Kimball.
        I've loved computers for as long as I can remember and music even longer than that! In addition to my hobbies that keep me joined at the hip with my computer, I love to run, hike, and sail.
        Since I've been at SMU I've enjoyed spending time with friends, greek life, slacklining (the balance based walking sport) and working on dev projects of my own. I am very passionate about interconectivity 
        and connected embedded devices.</p>
