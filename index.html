    <h2>About me</h2>
    <img src="assets/img/family2.jpg" alt="Me and my parents" style="width: 15vw; float: right; margin: 1rem 2rem">
    <p>My name is Addison Kimball, I am an independent software developer, fourth year Computer Science student at Southern Methodist University, Teaching Assistant and all-around curious human. 
        I have had a serious passion for computers my entire life, and the self-teaching that came as a result has instilled in me the utmost respect for self-education, freedom of knowledge, and open-source software, one of my serious interests. 
        While technology is what I am passionate about, it is the intersection of communication, leadership and technology that gets me the most excited. 
        Beyond my love of all things technology I am an avid long-distance runner and lifelong music-lover. </p>
